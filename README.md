# Pomodoro App

![Flutter](https://flutter.dev/assets/flutter-lockup-4cb0ee072ab312e59784d9fbf4fb7ad42688a7fdaea1270ccf6bbf4f34b7e03f.svg)

Created using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

The app's file structure is based off this one dude's medium post [here.](https://hackernoon.com/scalable-app-structure-in-flutter-dad61a4bc389)

The app also uses Redux for Flutter for state management. Learn more about there [here.](https://blog.novoda.com/introduction-to-redux-in-flutter/)

Enjoy. :)
